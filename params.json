  "body": "## Attention\r\nIf you, like me, are fascinated by the new developments in soft/hard attention. But you struggle to understand the exact mechanism. This post explains exactly that.\r\n\r\nIn this post we implement the basic soft attention. We run softmax with a dataset derived from MNIST. Soft attention is a complicated subject. Fortunately, MNIST digits are easy to understand and a good introduction.\r\n\r\n## Soft attention\r\nSoft attention originates from the captioning problem. In image captioning concerns with generating captions for images. Typical examples are shown below. \r\n\r\nIn such model, a CNN converts an image to a lower dimensional representation. This representation inputs into another network, typically a LSTM, which will generate natural language. In this pipeline, the LSTM receives representation of the image only once. We humans tend to look twice or more at an image while we describe the concent. The soft attention models exactly that. Every time-step, the LSTM outputs natural language to caption the image. For soft-attention, it also outputs a key, by which it attends to a part of the image. This information feeds in as input to the next time-step.\r\n\r\n## Stripped down\r\nIt might be hard to think how an LSTM takes a latent representation of an image to generate natural language. Therefore, this elementary model simply strips that part. Engineers typically struggle how to feed the representation, is it an input, a hidden state, a memory state ... We will not bother such complicated questions\r\n\r\n## Pipeline\r\nThe pipeline goes as follows. MNIST digits are handwritten digits 0,1,2 to 9. Typical convolutional neural networks manae to classify these above human accuracy. The activations of the first layer of such networks corresponds to an activation volume. After a convolutional layer and a max-pooling layer, the activation maps span 14 by 14 pixels. A layer typically consists of many neurons, in our case 12. The activation volume thus spans a Tensor of shape [14,14,12]\r\n\r\nThe LSTM outputs a key to attend to this activation volume. Researchers have been using three techniques to relate the key and the volume\r\n  * The key is __a heat map__ for the locations it attends to. This output key spans __[14,14]__, gets squashed by softmax and multiplies each channel\r\n  * The key __parametrizes a 2D Gaussian__. The output key spans __[5,]__ that paramtrize the mean and variances in x1 and x2 and a correlation coefficient, rho.\r\n  * The key is __a feature-like vector__ that indicates which features it atends to. This output key spans __[12,]__. An inner-product compares this vector to every other vector in the activation map. This results in a heat map, gets squashed by Softmax and multiplies each channel, like in the first option.\r\n\r\nThe Github repo demonstrates all three approaches. Respectively attention_main_sm.py, attention_main_gaussian.py and attention_main.py. \r\n\r\nFor the final option, with the feature-like vector, the next section displays results.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nDetails on the training. The activations stem from the first convlayer to classify MNIST. Activation maps are [14,14,12]. At the moment of extracting these images, the LSTM classified 83% correctly and was still improving. _I'm working on a five-year-old laptop, so training untill better performance takes long_\r\n\r\nThis visualization shows the attention mask at every time step of the ten. The final two plots display the sum over the activation volume and the original\r\n![Result1](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/attention/blob/master/masks01.png?raw=true)\r\n![Result2](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/attention/blob/master/masks02.png?raw=true)\r\n![Result3](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/attention/blob/master/masks03.png?raw=true)\r\n![Result4](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/attention/blob/master/masks04.png?raw=true)\r\n![Result5](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/attention/blob/master/masks05.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nNote that the colorbar applies to only the first ten images. The final two images are auto-scaled.\r\nRed indicates high attention in the mask. Blue indicates low attention\r\n## Improvements\r\nAs we display an elementary example, there's many room for improvements. Some of which are\r\n  * __Temperature of softmax__ For some applications, you might restrict the regions that the soft-attention can attend to. Lowering the temperature of the Softmax does exactly that\r\n  * __Feeding initial states__ Many, if not all, of the soft-attentions initialize the hidden state and memory state of the LSTM with some representation\r\n  * __Combine approaches for attending__ We discussed pipelines for the output key to attend to the activation volume. Such approaches also allow for combination. You might want to have a feature-like key and also a heatmap for the locations, and so on\r\n\r\nAs always, I am curious to any comments and questions.
